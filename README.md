Multi-Modal AI Powered Adventure Game! Explore the Dungeons as a Warrior, Fight Demons and Find Treasures (NFTs) that convert into Real world Money!

# Description
Its a Text and Image based RPG Adventure game where you control the Character using your prompts. Text and Images describe the scene which are always unique. AI Shines here as there are no dead ends apart from Game Mechanics restricting stuff like NSFW, out of scope actions etc. Players would interact with the game through prompts and make decisions that affect the storyline. The actual gameplay and adventure would occur off-chain, meaning it doesn't directly interact with blockchain networks. However, important events such as finding treasures, leveling up, and character progression would be monitored on the blockchain. So say if a person finds a treasure (NFT) which is fine-tuned AI Image generator ensuring every Treasure (NFT) is unique but still consistent and recognizable. Once the Treasure is found in-game a pop up appears which gives the person the ability to either Burn it or Mint it once minted they sign it and it's on a market palce platform like OpenSea. This ensures  the rarity is decided by the public.
